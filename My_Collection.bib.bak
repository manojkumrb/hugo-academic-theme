abstract = {An integrated problem of optimising the operations at a commercial bulk material port terminal is studied in this paper. We simultaneously optimise the stockyard operations and rake schedule for outbound cargo, in conjunction with the arriving vessels and the status of the stockyards at the port. A mixed integer linear programming model for the problem is developed while incorporating the inherent complexities of the integrated model. To solve the real-life instances, two heuristic methods are proposed specifically for the considered problem. Firstly, genetic algorithm coupled with a greedy heuristic and later, block-based evolutionary algorithm (BBEA) is employed. After applying both techniques, we obtain the optimised schedule for loading of rakes and allotment of stockyard space for vessels as well as rakes at the terminal. Finally, we test the results of both models in three traffic scenarios between themselves and with real-life data from a port situated along the Eastern coast of India. The study resulted in significant reduction of turnaround time for rakes at the port terminal, which in turn lead to monetary savings. The model also automates the day to day operational decision-making at the port.},

abstract = {3D surface metrology scanners are primarily used for surface reconstruction in reverse engineering and for off-line inspection of parts but, their application potential for in-line process control remains largely unexplored. The lack of usage of 3D surface metrology scanners for in-line process control can be attributed to the large processing time of metrology equipment compared to the cycle time of automotive assembly systems. To overcome this challenge, a novel methodology for adaptive measurement and modelling of data captured by in-line 3D surface measurement systems is proposed in this paper. The methodology models part deviations by augmenting the scanner data with spatio-temporal correlations in deviation field and enables efficient implementation of in-line part shape measurement for process control. The proposed methodology consists of two steps: (i) modelling deviations to enable prediction of entire part deviations with partial measurements, and; (ii) adaptively selecting part regions to be measured by taking into account the measurement data available from the scanner up to current time-step. The partial measurement strategy based on deviation modeling and adaptive region selection results in maximum information gain within the given assembly system cycle time. The prediction of entire part surface deviation with higher confidence leads to effective identification of part-to-part defect variation patterns. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on an automotive door component.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. Accurate modelling of geometric and dimensional errors of sheet metal parts is crucial in designing correct GD{\&}T and preventing unnecessary design changes during the development and launch of a new assembly process. A novel conditional simulation based methodology to probabilistically model and generate non-ideal sheet metal part geometric variations is developed. The methodology generates part geometric variations, which accurately emulate part fabrication process in terms of covariance of generated deviations. The methodology uses as inputs one or more of the following: Measurement data of current parts, historical measurements of similar parts or FEM-based simulations. The proposed methodology emulates real processes and products accurately by generating non-ideal part representatives based on the aforementioned input data. Results provide an easy engineering interpretation to the designer. The methodology is demonstrated using automotive door hinge reinforcement.},
