  I am a research assistant in the [Digital Life-cycle Management Group](https://go.warwick.ac.uk/DLM) at WMG, University of the Warwick. I have submitted my doctoral dissertation and am awaiting my viva. My doctoral research focused on utilising the spatial and spatio-temporal correlations in a manufacturing assembly process to improve the quality of the product during the early design phase.
